# SQL2MSFOL
SQL2MSFOL is an implementation of mapping from SQL statements to Many-Sorted First-Order Logic (MSFOL). This Java implementation based on the mapping definition described in the manuscript [Proving correctness for SQL implementations of OCL constraints]().

In a nutshell, given a datamodel, SQL2MSFOL maps an SQL statement into a complete FOL formulae written in [SMT-LIB2](https://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/papers/smt-lib-reference-v2.6-r2021-05-12.pdf) language.

## Supported language and features:

Although SQL2MSFOL covers a large subset of SQL statements and expressions, 
the implementation is an on-going project. 
The following items highlight the supported subset of SQL select statement:
```
SELECT selectitems
SELECT selectitems FROM fromitem
SELECT selectitems FROM fromitem WHERE whereExpr
SELECT selectitems FROM fromitem JOIN fromitem
SELECT selectitems FROM fromitem JOIN fromitem ON onExpr
SELECT selectitems FROM fromitem JOIN fromitem WHERE whereExpr
SELECT selectitems FROM fromitem JOIN fromitem ON onExpr WHERE whereExpr
```
where
```
selectitems := expr (, expr)*
fromitem    := class AS alias
             | association-class AS alias
             | subselect AS alias
whereExpr   := boolexpr
onExpr      := boolexpr
```
and
```
expr := TRUE | FALSE | NULL    (boolean literals)
      | ... | -1 | 0 | 1 | ... (integer literals)
      | var                    (variables)
      | 'a string'             (string literals)
      | alias.id               (class-id)
      | alias.attribute        (class-attributes)
      | alias.association-end  (association-ends)
      | NOT boolexpr           (unary operations)
      | boolexpr AND boolexpr  (binary operations, i.e., AND, OR)
      | expr = expr            (binary comparisons, i.e., =, <>, >, <, >=, <=)
      | expr IS NULL           (IS NULL expression)
      | CASE WHEN boolexpr THEN expr ELSE expr END
                               (CASE expression)
      | EXISTS subselect       (EXISTS expression)
```

## How to use

### Requirements:
- (required) `Maven 3` and `Java 1.8` (or higher).
- (submodule) [`datamodel`](https://github.com/oclsqlprover/dm2schema).
- The project delegates the SQL text-to-object transformation the [`JSQLParser`](https://github.com/JSQLParser/JSqlParser) library (version 4.2.x).

**Note**: These dependecies are imported in Maven.

The submodules will be updated using `Git` commands as in the guideline.

### Quick guideline:
```
git clone https://github.com/oclsqlprover/SQL2MSFOL.git
```
and run the file `scripts.sh` to install the aforementioned packages locally:

```
.\scripts.sh
```
To execute the tool, have a look at the example main class `Runner.java` for a quick guideline.
